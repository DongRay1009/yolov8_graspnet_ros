# YOLOv8 3D Object Detection Models

This directory contains the models used for the YOLOv8 3D object detection project. Below are the details regarding the models, including how to download and use them.

## Model Overview

The YOLOv8 model is designed for real-time object detection in 3D environments. It leverages advanced deep learning techniques to accurately identify and localize objects in three-dimensional space.

## Model Download

To use the YOLOv8 model, you need to download the pre-trained weights. You can find the model weights at the following link:

[Download YOLOv8 Model Weights](https://example.com/yolov8_weights)

Make sure to place the downloaded weights in the appropriate directory as specified in the configuration files.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Configuration**: Update the `detector_params.yaml` file in the `config` directory with the path to the downloaded model weights.

2. **Running the Detector**: Use the provided ROS launch files to start the detection node. For example, you can run:

   ```
   roslaunch yolov8_3d detector.launch
   ```

3. **Visualizing Results**: After running the detector, you can visualize the detection results using the provided visualization scripts.

## Additional Information

For more details on how to customize the model or train your own version, please refer to the main project documentation in the `README.md` file located in the root directory of the project.
